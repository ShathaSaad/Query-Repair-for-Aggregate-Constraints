Efficient Query Repair for Aggregate Constraints

Abstract






Algorithms
1-	Brute force algorithm, to test it remove the comment in main.py.
2-	Full cluster filtering Algorithm (FF)
3-	Cluster range pruning (RP).

Datasets
- We are using 3 datasets in Datasets folder: ACSIncome, Healthcare and TPCH.
- Edit each dataset's path in Dataframe.py.

How to run experiments
-	Set the configuration in main.py such as the dataName, dataSize, QueryNumber, â€¦ etc.
-	Change the outputDirectory which after running the main.py, will contains the output of each algorithm and summary table.
-	Run main.py

Where to find the paper
The technical report is exist at extended version.
