# Query-Refinment-for-Complex-Constraints
Efficient Query Repair for Aggregate Constraints

Abstract


Algorithms
1-	Brute force algorithm, to test it remove the comment in main.py.
2-	Full cluster filtering Algorithm (FF)
3-	Cluster range pruning (RP).

Datasets
We are using 3 datasets: 
-	ACSIncome and Healthcare in InputData file.
-	TPCH in TPC-H file.

How to run experiments
-	Set the configuration in main.py such as the dataName, dataSize, QueryNumber, â€¦ etc.
-	Run main.py

Where to find the paper
The technical report is exist at extended version.
